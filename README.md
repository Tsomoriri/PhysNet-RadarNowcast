# PhysNet-RadarNowcast
Applying PINN to radar data for nowcasting weather

redo input data and output data config
add cfl
add loss for mass conservation
maybe more resolution

_____________________________
change in ux and uy --> trainable
explore:
 diffferent NAS parameters
 different loss functions
 different way to calculate accuracy
 boundary conditions

explore more equations simple
